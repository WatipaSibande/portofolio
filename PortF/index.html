<section class="about" id="about">
    <p>As a programmer I write, test, and develop programs that operate computers.<br>
    I also design and develop programs that solve problems. <br>
    It is essential to work hand in hand with other computer specialists, <br>
    New technologies and computer languages have redefined the programmer's role.<br>
    Computer software engineers and system analysts specify the programs computer programmers develop.<br>
    Engineers and system analysts design software and programmers convert engineer designs <br>
    into programs that operate computers. Programmers code programs into a computer language<br> 
    such as COBOL, Prolong, an artificial intelligence language, or an advanced object oriented<br>
     language such as Java, C++, or ACTOR. Programming languages are determined by the program's <br>
     purpose. Programmers usually understand more than one language and since languages are very <br>
     similar, many programmers can learn new languages quickly. Programmers are often classified by<br>
      their language or program specialty, for example, JAVA or mainframe programmers.</p>

    <h2>Proficiency with programming languages</h2>
        <p>Code is written in programming languages such as SQL, Java, C++, or Python. Programmers aren't expected to know every programming<br>
        language in existence, but it would be beneficial to be proficient in at least two languages to increase your employment and career <br>
        opportunities. Most programmers typically decide on an area of specialization and then learn the programming language that is most <br>
        appropriate for that field.</p><br>

    <h2>Mathematical Skills</h2>
    <p>
        Many aspects of programming require an understanding of math beyond the basic level. To become proficient at programming, you will<br>
         need to have a thorough understanding of algebra and arithmetic.</p>    
        <br>
     <h2>Debugging</h2>   
     <p>Programmers often must debug code in response to detected errors.
